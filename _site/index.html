Throughout my degree I have worked on a variety of projects and developed a passion for front-end dev using various industry standard frameworks.

</p><p>This project was part of my third year course work in COMP 3380, and was a group project with 2 other students. We were tasked with creating a database, and also had to create an interface to interact with the database. I was responsible for the adjustments and modifications of the terminal interface, and I also used my knowledge of <mark>SQL</mark> to create the database, populate it with data and make interesting <mark>queries</mark>.</p>

Being the lead front-end developer with the highest number of commit contributions, I was responsible for creating the interface using <mark>react</mark> and make it come to life. Some of the particular components that I created were the search bar, navigation arrows and feedback driven animations throughout the interface.</p>

The application that we picked was about food recipes, and part of my responsibilities included creating the front-end component of creating a recipe and viewing a recipe. I also worked on the back-end component of the application, which included creating a database, adding images and connecting it to the front-end.
I was also part of testing and was responsible for creating test cases for unit, integration and acceptance tests and testing the application.</p>
