          This was one of the first group project that I worked on and I learned a lot about working in a team and using databases.

          This project was part of my third year course work in COMP 3380, and was a group project with 2 other students. We were tasked with creating a database, and also had to create an interface to interact with the database. I was responsible for the adjustments and modifications of the terminal interface, and I also used my knowledge of SQL to create the database, populate it with data and make interesting queries.

            The very first project that introduced me to the world of front-end development and react, and it was love at first sight.

            This was part of my third year course work in COMP 3020, and we were tasked with creating an interactive library that employed gestalt principles to reduce friction between human and computer.
            Being the lead front-end developer with the highest number of commit contributions, I was responsible for creating the interface using react and make it come to life. Some of the particular components that I created were the search bar, navigation arrows and feedback driven animations throughout the interface.
