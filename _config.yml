          This was one of the first group project that I worked on and I learned a lot about working in a team and using databases.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          This project was part of my third year course work in COMP 3380, and was a group project with 2 other students. We were tasked with creating a database, and also had to create an interface to interact with the database. I was responsible for the adjustments and modifications of the terminal interface, and I also used my knowledge of <mark>SQL</mark> to create the database, populate it with data and make interesting <mark>queries</mark>.

          The very first project that introduced me to the world of front-end development and react, and it was love at first sight.

          This was part of my third year course work in COMP 3020, and we were tasked with creating an interactive library that employed gestalt principles to reduce friction between human and computer.
          Being the lead front-end developer with the highest number of commit contributions, I was responsible for creating the interface using <mark>react</mark> and make it come to life. Some of the particular components that I created were the search bar, navigation arrows and feedback driven animations throughout the interface.

          Software Engineering 1 was a great course that taught me a lot about working in a team and using agile methodologies.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          This was part of my third year course work in COMP 3350, and we were tasked with creating an Android application using <mark>Android Studio</mark>. The application that we picked was about food recipes, and part of my responsibilities included creating the front-end component of creating a recipe and viewing a recipe. I also worked on the back-end component of the application, which included creating a database, adding images and connecting it to the front-end.
          I was also part of testing and was responsible for creating test cases for unit, integration and acceptance tests and testing the application.

          Taking my software engineering skills to the next level, I am currently working on a project that is much more complex.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          This is part of my fourth year course work in COMP 4350, and my team is tasked with creating a web application. For this one, we have picked to create a brand-new social media platform that is based on the idea of having close knit communities.
          I am the second lead front-end developer and I am responsible for creating multiple components of the interface. I am using react as our core framework for front-end development, and for components I have worked extensively with the <mark>Mantine</mark> library.
          I have also worked with <mark>Formik</mark> for form handling, <mark>yup</mark> for schema validations, and I am also responsible for integrating the back-end component of the application using various AWS services like <mark>Amplify</mark>, <mark>Lambda</mark>, <mark>AppSync</mark>, <mark>DynamoDB</mark>, <mark>CloudWatch</mark>.
